# gridsome-vuetify-starter
> A Gridsome + Vuetify starter with no other configuration needed. 

This repository will get you quickly up and running with the power of Gridsome and Vuetify using either `gridsome create your-repo-name https://github.com/12vanblart/gridsome-vuetify-starter` and replacing `your-repo-name` with the desired name for your new repository or [GitHub's Template Repository functionality](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)

If you need to install Vuetify to an existing project, you can find the instructions [on Gridsome.org](https://gridsome.org/docs/assets-css/#vuetify). 

## Updates
- As of Aug 8th 2019, this has been updated to bring in Vuetify 2.0 instead of version 1.5. 
- 11/4/2019 - ESLint now comes installed with the template and Vuetify + Gridsome versions have been updated. (Thanks [@DavidCouronne](https://github.com/DavidCouronne)!!)
